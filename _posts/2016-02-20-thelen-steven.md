    I have known Anthony DeFrancesco since 2012...  and over that time he has created many amazing web applications, desktop / website automation, data  interfaces and dynamic reporting.  He is extremely talented, personable and very easy to work with...  he always seems to rise to the occasion and deliver great quality products.
    <br/><br/>I have met many people in my life who claim to be able to do many things...  Anthony is one of the rare people who can deliver on what he promises.   He always goes above and beyond to meet the needs of his customer...  while being efficient and effective.
    <br/><br/>I truly couldn't be happier with all that Anthony has built for me over the years...  he is an amazing Developer.
